# Never edit .css files or .min.js files directly. Build them from the source:

### to edit css or js:

first install the gulp cli on your computer 
https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start

install node packages with `npm i`

then run `gulp watch` each time you sit down to make changes to the source files. 

Commit your changes after you see your console print a "finished" message. It should take about 1 second.
